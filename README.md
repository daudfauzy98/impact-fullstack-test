# Impact Fullstack Test

This project is using `PostgreSQL` for the database. I've included the database file `impact_db.sql` in the `backend` folder. The DB's name is exactly with the file name. I'm using `Golang` for the `backend` and `ReactJS` for the frontend.

### How to Run The Project

#### Backend
`go run .`<br>
The service is running at port 8000

#### Frontend
* `npm install`
* `npm run start`
<br>The service is running at port 8001
